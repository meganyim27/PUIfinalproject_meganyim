                <p class="details">Seattle was my first solo trip that I took with my United benefits. It was a day trip where I flew from Chicago to Seattle in the morning, and flew back that same night. I had never been to Seattle before, and I didn’t have a car with me, so I was limited to walkable-distances form downtown Seattle. I really liked the bustling environment that downtown Seattle had, and the one day I was there, the weather was really beautiful.</p>

                    <ul class="details">
                        <li>On my plane ride to Seattle, I got a beautiful picutre of Mount Rainier from the sky.</li>
                        <li>I got to go to the top of the Space Needle and see the entire Seattle from a view high above. It was really cool and reminded me of the Empire State Building view of New York. There was a spinning deck that showed you a 360° view of Seattle as the deck slowly turns. </li>
                        <li>I also got to see the Chihuly Garden and Glass Exhibit that is right next to the Space Needle. It was a very unique experience and different from any other museum that I have been to. It is an exhibit that showcases the glass masterpieces of Dale Chihuly. There were pieces that hung from the ceilings, on the ground, and on the walls. </li>
                        <li>I really loved that I got the chance to see the very first Starbucks. At the heart of downtown Seattle, the very first Starbucks is now a tourist attraction and it has unique Starbucks merchandise that no other stores have. Sadly, I did not go inside since the line was too long, but was able to take a picture!</li>

                                <p>This is an outdoors farmers market that has a lot of fresh produce, stalls for flower bouquets, restaurants and more. One stall that is very known for their employees throwing fish around, making it a show for people passing by. This market also supports a lot of local artisan crafts-makers so there is a lot of souvenirs and home-made goods to buy.</p>

                                <p>The Space Needle is most probably the most famous attraction in Seattle. On the top of the Space Needle, you can see Mount Rainier along with all the different views of the city. It is so interesting to see the different parts of Seattle, some parts are more commercial-like with tall buildings, while other parts of Seattle are more residential-focused.</p>

                                <p>I think this is a lesser known park in Seattle, but I think it has the most beautiful view of the Seattle horizon. It is so pretty to come here during sunrise and sunset hours because you can see the entire sunset sky colors as well as see the sun reflect off the Space Needle.</p>
