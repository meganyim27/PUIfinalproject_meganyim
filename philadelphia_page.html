                <p class="details">Philadelphia was a trip that I took with my CMU a cappella group, Joyful Noise. Each year, a collection of christian a cappella groups around the U.S. come together to put on a concert for the community of a certain city. This event is called Break-It-Down or BID. In 2022, we went to Boston (BIDB), having the concert hosted Boston University’s christian a cappella group, Mustard Seed. In 2023, we went to Philadelphia (BIDP), with the concert hosted by University of Pennsylvania’s christian a cappella group, Full Measure. Throughout the weekend, we hang out with the members of the other groups, sing on the streets to spread awareness about our event (busking), and performed at a concert. This upcoming year, we will have Break-It-Down New York (BIDNY)!!</p>

                    <ul class="details">
                        <li>Busking is a tradition that we do during Break-It-Down that involves a pair of groups to go out to the streets and sing songs to the people passing by, hoping to spread awareness about our concert to the community of Philly. We were paired with UC Berkeley’s christian a cappella group, For Christ’s Sake. We had lunch and got to hear each other’s songs.</li>
                        <li>The concert that we had during Break-It-Down-Philadephia was amazing as well. In a giant auditorium, it was filled with strangers that heard about the event through our busking as well as many alumni from each group. Each a cappella sang 1-2 songs to share with everyone what they have been learning over the past year. The audience is super supportive and at the end, all the a cappellas come together to sing a song.</li>
                        <li>Many people from different a cappella groups went to the same church on Sunday and we all went to get philly cheesesteaks together afterwards. In the restaurant, since we were a large group of people, the employees invited us to sing The Lord Bless You to the people there.</li>

                                <p>This is a famous indoor farmer’s market that is in downtown Philadelphia. It is filled with food vendors that sells sweets, fruits, desserts, and more. It is one of the U.S. oldest public market and it supports many of its local farmers and merchants. There are 100+ vendors in the Reading Temrinal, so it is also a fun place to explore for the day.</p>

It is in the JFK Plaza, so the love sign is by a beautiful park where people can relax and enjoy the outsides as well.</p>

                                <p>The Philly Chinatown is very close to the Reading Terminal. When we were at the Chinatown, we went to a restaurant that was famous for their grilled skewers called Chuang Kee. Philly Chinatown is very worth to go because you can all see all the Chinese ulture that happens in Philly. While the Chinatown in Philadelphia is not the largest CHinatown in the U.S., it is still very prominent in Philly.</p>
